    <p>Azikiwe was born on 16 November <strong>1904</strong> in Zungeru, Northern Nigeria. His first name means "my father is alive" in the Igbo language, and his parents were Igbo. His father, <strong>Obed-Edom Chukwuemeka Azikiwe</strong>(1879–3 March 1958), a native Onye Onicha, was a clerk in the British Administration of Nigeria who traveled extensively as part of his job. Azikiwe's mother was <strong>Rachel Chinwe Ogbenyeanu (Aghadiuno) Azikiwe</strong> (1883-January 1958),who was sometimes called Nwanonaku and was the third daughter of Aghadiuno Ajie. Her family descended from a royal family in Onitsha, and her paternal great-grandfather was Obi (Ugogwu) Anazenwu. Azikiwe had one sibling, a sister named Cecilia Eziamaka Arinze.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Azikiwe attended Storer College's two-year preparatory school in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia.</li>
      <li>To fund his living expenses and tuition, he worked a number of menial jobs before enrolling in <strong>Howard University in Washington, D.C.</strong> in 1927 to obtain a Bachelor’s degree in Political Science</li>
      <li>In 1929, he transferred from Howard University to Lincoln University to complete his undergraduate studies and graduated in 1930 with a BA in Political Science. Azikwe took courses with Alain Locke. Azikiwe was a member of Phi Beta Sigma.</li>
      <li> He then enrolled at Lincoln University in Pennsylvania and in the University of Pennsylvania simultaneously in 1930, receiving a master's degree in religion from Lincoln University and a master's degree in anthropology from the University of Pennsylvania in 1932</li>
      <li>Azikiwe became a graduate-student instructor in the history and political-science departments at Lincoln University, where he created a course in African history. He was a candidate for a doctoral degree at Columbia University before returning to Nigeria in 1934.</li>
      <li>Azikiwe's doctoral research focused on Liberia in world politics, and his research paper was published by A. H. Stockwell in 1934. During his time in America, he was a columnist for the Baltimore Afro-American, Philadelphia Tribune and the Associated Negro Press. Azikiwe was influenced by the ideals of the African-American press, Garveyism and pan-Africanism</li>
      <li>He applied as a foreign-service official for Liberia, but was rejected because he was not a native of the country. By 1934, when Azikiwe returned to Lagos, he was well-known and viewed as a public figure by some members of the Lagos and Igbo community as his writings in America evidently reached Nigeria.</li>
      <li>Azikiwe became governor-general on 16 November 1960, with Abubakar Tafawa Balewa as prime minister, and became the first Nigerian named to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom.</li>
      <li>When Nigeria became a republic in 1963, he was its first president. In both posts, Azikiwe's role was largely ceremonial.</li>

        <blockquote cite='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._Odumegwu_Ojukwu'>He and his civilian colleagues were removed from office in the 15 January 1966 military coup, and he was the most prominent politician to avoid assassination after the coup. Azikiwe was a spokesman for Biafra and advised its leader, Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu, during the Biafran War (1967–1970)</blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>Azikiwe died aged 91 on 11 May <strong>1996</strong> at the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital in Enugu after a long illness, and is buried in his native Onitsha.</li>
